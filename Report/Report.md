# Question

### Quick start

1. Back to the Dockerfile before, if itâ€™s a Spring Boot app, can I just run `java -jar` rather than `gradle run` for starting the Spring boot app?
    1. Experiment later.
2. No question but a note about Spring Behind Architecture & Bean. Will re-read them on the way.

### Spring Core

1. Setter injection: used when having optional dependencies? What is an optional deps, use case?
2. Read bean scopes later
